            <h3>ABOUT LINCOLN CALLING</h3>
            <p>Lincoln Calling is an annual, non-profit music festival occurring across multiple venues in downtown Lincoln, Nebraska. Since its inception in 2003, the festival has thrived on a DIY mentality, showcasing rock, hip-hop, punk, indie pop, metal, DJs, folk and much more. Nebraska’s best bands share billings with nationally known acts, including Gillian Welch & Dave Rawlings, Future Islands, BOY, Ivan & Alyosha, Tilly and the Wall, The Hood Internet, Those Darlins and many more. And while Lincoln Calling has varied slightly in length and venue participation in its lifetime, in recent years it’s consistently offered in the vicinity of 100 performances.</p>
            <p>Now in its 13th year, Lincoln Calling will be held Oct. 6-8 across nearly a dozen locations. Most critically, the festival is committed to being an accessible, affordable and easily navigable exhibition of the city’s arts scene — including comedy, film and visual art — as well as Lincoln’s promise for attracting top flight national talent.</p>
